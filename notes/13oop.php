<!-- OOP in PHP -->

<!-- 
Key Concepts to Remember: 
  Objects = Self-contained unit that encapsulates properties and methods
  Classes = Blueprints for an object
  Inheritance = Allows one class to inherit properties/methods from another
  Encapsulation = Bundling the data and methods into a single unit
  Polymorphism = Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass
